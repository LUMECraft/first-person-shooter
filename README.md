# `first-persion-shooter`

A first-person shooter game foundation made with [LUME](https://lume.io/),
[Solid.js](https://solidjs.com/) (and libs), and
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).

LUMECraft's `first-person-shooter` aims to be an open-source starting point for
FPS games written declaratively using LUME's 3D HTML elements with Solid.js
templating and reactivity, and realtime multiplayer connectivity powered by
Meteor.js. Eventually it will be skinnable, moddable, and more.
